My name is GÃªdhean Alves Vieira and that's my blog. I love to know how things work and that's why I choose to become an engineer.
I spend most of my free time learning about new things or going out with my girlfriend (we love try something new and exciting). My interests are in the range of engineering, technology, software and artificial intelligence.

### Why this blog exists

I made this blog to write down things I've learned and experienced, so I can go back and refresh my memory.
Besides that, it's a way to share something useful that can help someone.

*It's a pleasure to have you here.*
